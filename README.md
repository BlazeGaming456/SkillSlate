## 🧑‍💻 Challenges Faced

- **Latex Generation and Latex to PDF Generation**
  One of the main difficulties I faced was for the generation of the latex code as well as its conversion into PDF.
  It was difficult especially intially to generate the appropriate latex code, so that the form data is converted into a properly formatted PDF.
  To convert the latex code into PDF, I had started the project thinking of using free online compilers, however, half way through the project realized that they had a specific limit on the code allowed and would not be suitable for the project.
  This meant that I would have to create a suitabel latex compiler backend that was then deployed on Railway and used to generate the required resumes and cover letter in th eproject now.
  It was a great learning experience, and was very fruitful.

- **Prompt Engineering and AI Output:**  
  Crafting effective prompts for Gemini to generate high-quality, ATS-optimized, and visually consistent resume content.
  Especially in the case of improving specific points given by the user.

- **UI/UX Consistency & Browser Cachin Issues:**  
  Achieving a modern, visually appealing, and consistent design across all sections, including responsive layouts and animated elements.
  Also faced issues ensuring the favicon and static assets update correctly despite browser caching.
